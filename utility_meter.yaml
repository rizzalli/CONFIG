# Utility meter definitions for long-term energy analytics
# IMPORTANT: Replace sensor.energy_consumption with your actual energy sensor (kWh, state_class: total_increasing)
# Examples: sensor.grid_consumption, sensor.total_energy, sensor.shelly_xxx_energy, etc.

energy_daily:
  source: sensor.energy_consumption
  cycle: daily

energy_monthly:
  source: sensor.energy_consumption
  cycle: monthly

# If you have solar production, uncomment and set the correct source sensors
#solar_production_daily:
#  source: sensor.solar_energy_production
#  cycle: daily
#solar_production_monthly:
#  source: sensor.solar_energy_production
#  cycle: monthly
