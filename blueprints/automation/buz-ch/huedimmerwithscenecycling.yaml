blueprint:
  name: Time-Adaptive Hue Dimmer with Scene Cycling, Per-Scene Type, and HA Scenes
  description: 'Control lights with the Hue dimmer, with **time-based adaptive color
    temperature and brightness** *integrated* into the ''on'' action. If lights do
    not turn on, try holding on to override the detection logic<br/> Scene type is
    selectable *per individual scene* with "Home Assistant Scene", alongside RGB Color
    and Color Temperature (Kelvin) as options. <br/><br/>


    **✨ Features: ✨** <ul> <li>**Hue Dimmer Control:** Implements on, off, increase
    and dim brightness with minimal configuration - scene cycling requires a helper,
    sadly.</li> <li>**Time-Integrated Adaptive Lighting:** Time-of-day color temperature
    and brightness are applied *when lights are turned ON* via the dimmer if they
    were off. Brightness adjustments maintain the current color temperature.</li>
    <li>**Versatile Customizable Scenes (Per-Scene Type Selection):** Define up to
    7 lighting scenes with custom **RGB colors**, **color temperature (Kelvin)**,
    *or* **activate pre-defined Home Assistant Scenes**. **Choose between RB Color,
    Color Temperature, or Home Assistant Scene *for each scene individually*.**</li>
    <li>**Scene Cycling:** Cycle through the defined scenes using the **''Off'' button
    (short press)** on the Hue dimmer. The first press after automation start will
    activate scene 1, subsequent presses will cycle through scene 2, scene 3, ...,
    scene 7, and back to scene 1.  **Scene index is tracked using an `input_text`
    helper.**</li> <li>**Simplified Time Settings:** Only start times are needed for
    each adaptive lighting period (Morning, Day, Evening, Night).</li> <li>**Smooth
    Transitions:** Option for smooth transitions for dimmer button actions and initial
    adaptive lighting setting. **Separate, shorter transition time for brightness
    adjustments.**</li> </ul> **✨ Setup: ✨** <br/> Minimally you need to set up the
    first three fields: <ul> <li>MQTT Topic</li> <li>Lights to be acted upon (entities
    preferred, but devices and areas should work too) </li> <li> Scene Index Input
    Text Entity ID</li> </ul> Remainder can run with defaults but the scene cycling
    may be a bit underwhelming (and defaults to RGB which may be an issue for non
    RGB bulbs).

        <br/> For this blueprint to work correctly, it is **recommended** that you
        name your `input_text` entities using the following convention, which is based
        on your **MQTT Topic**:<br/> <br/> `hue_dimmer_scene_index_{{ MQTT_TOPIC_FRIENDLY_NAME
        }}_input_text`<br/> <br/> where `{{ MQTT_TOPIC_FRIENDLY_NAME }}` is derived
        from the last part of your configured MQTT Topic, with any invalid characters
        replaced by underscores.<br/> <br/> **Example:**<br/> If your MQTT Topic for
        a dimmer is `zigbee2mqtt/living_room_dimmer`, you should create an input_text
        entity with the Entity ID:<br/> <br/> `hue_dimmer_scene_index_living_room_dimmer_input_text`<br/>
